- similar keys (bit distance?) give similar encryptions.  use this to
  hunt for keys.

- plaintext that goes 0,1,2,3... will xor count.

- eight bit shows state directly.

- can we construct state / keys from known plaintext (all zeroes)

- since plaintext has patterns, and plaintext critical for randomness, 
  ordinary text will not be random when encrypted.

- does state repeat too quickly?  what about with text?

- check decryption is possible!
