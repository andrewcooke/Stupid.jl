- similar keys (bit distance?) give similar encryptions.  use this to
  hunt for keys.  genetic?

- plaintext that goes 0,1,2,3... will xor count.

- eight bit shows state directly.

- can we construct state / keys from known plaintext (all zeroes)

- since plaintext has patterns, and plaintext critical for randomness, 
  ordinary text will not be random when encrypted.

- does state repeat too quickly?  what about with text?

- early cipher only depends on part of key?  incremental crack?

- if you look at the text vectors, constant values encrypt to the same
  value, except for a prefix.  how general is this?  is the encryption
  some kind of differential?  what does that mean?

- just run it backwards.  when we can't infer, guess.  how does that
  reduce the search space?

- measure how long it takes to change key by position.  how variable
  it is.
