ADDRESSED

- similar keys (bit distance?) give similar encryptions.  use this to
  hunt for keys.  genetic?

- plaintext that goes 0,1,2,3... will xor count (state constantly zero
  if key also zero).

- if you look at the text vectors, constant values encrypt to the same
  value, except for a prefix.  how general is this?  is the encryption
  some kind of differential?  what does that mean?  [it was a bug]

- the example ciphers show very little variation even with very
  different keys.  why [it was a bug]?  how to exploit this?

- can we poison the state with a counter prefix, then extract the state,
  then continue?

- it seems like state from the key "dies out" over time (counter and
  zero plaintexts).  if so, then maybe long text tends to the same
  "self-encryted" value, no matter what the key.  if so, then we can
  look for patterns related to common fragments.

- how does injection attack actually work, since it doesn't null
  counter?  is counter really necessary?  is it just sucky general
  behaviour?  do constants work?  [it looks like it's mainly a double
  xor; counter works better than constants.]

- can we see the counter in the output?  if we encrypt text (ie not
  random), can we seen the signature of the counter xored with the
  output?  a distinguishing attack.

- is output similar to text?  measure bit distance letter by letter.
  look at whether there is a lag (cross-correlation).


PARTIALLY ADDRESSED 

- does state repeat too quickly?  what about with text?

- what's the distance between the same text with different keys?
  maybe it's less than expected because self-encrypting dominates the
  key after some time?

- distinguishing attacks are a thing, so do stats.


NOT ADDRESSED

- can we construct state / keys from known plaintext (all zeroes)?

- eight bit shows state directly.

- early cipher only depends on part of key?  incremental crack?

- maybe set up a sat solver?! (poc using text; if it works, wrap).

- when plaintext unknown, just run it backwards.  when we can't infer,
  guess.  how does that reduce the search space?  maybe with a reduced
  alphabet?  [harder than expected ;o]


- measure how long it takes to change key by position.  how variable
  it is.

- quantify how things (don't) scale with keysize.


- for large, random keys, and constant plaintext, what structure do we
  see?  are different keys similar in some way?  what happens when the
  plaintext has structure too?  are there correlations at 256 bytes
  (counter looping)?

- since plaintext has patterns, and plaintext critical for randomness, 
  ordinary text will not be random when encrypted.

- building statistics for the cipher is tricky because output depends
  on the plaintext.  we could use the following plaintexts:
  - constant value (0x0, 0xff or 0x55)
  - random values
  - pair-repeated random values from the lower 4 bits
  - a known text file
  and use the NIST suite of tests.  but we can likely already guess
  that only random input will look random.

- statistics of the ciphertext xored with the plaintext are more
  interesting, because that is showing the "effective prng" for a
  classical stream cipher.  we can see how that varies with different
  plaintexts and keys.

- measure diffusion(?) - change a bit in the key and see how the
  ciphertext changes.

- encrypt the same text many times using different keys.  can we
  combine the encrypted streams in a way that reveals the text?  in
  other words, if the underlying generator is not random then the xor
  between two ciphertexts will show... what?  what statistic would
  suggest that this is a good idea? 

- when the same plaintext is encrypted by multiple keys, can we
  detect any similarity in the ciphertexts?


- adaptive plaintext attack attempting to zero internal state
