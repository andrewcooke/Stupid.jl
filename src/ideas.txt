- similar keys (bit distance?) give similar encryptions.  use this to
  hunt for keys.  genetic?

- is output similar to text?  measure bit distance letter by letter.
  look at whether there is a lag (cross-correlation).

- plaintext that goes 0,1,2,3... will xor count (state constantly zero
  if key also zero).

- eight bit shows state directly.

- can we construct state / keys from known plaintext (all zeroes)?

- since plaintext has patterns, and plaintext critical for randomness, 
  ordinary text will not be random when encrypted.

- does state repeat too quickly?  what about with text?

- early cipher only depends on part of key?  incremental crack?

- if you look at the text vectors, constant values encrypt to the same
  value, except for a prefix.  how general is this?  is the encryption
  some kind of differential?  what does that mean?

- just run it backwards.  when we can't infer, guess.  how does that
  reduce the search space?

- maybe set up a sat solver?!

- measure how long it takes to change key by position.  how variable
  it is.

- quantify how things (don't) scale with keysize.

- what happens if you xor ciphertext with the same plaintext encrypted
  with an empty key?  what happens if you xor ciphertext with empty
  plaintext and the same key?  what happens if you xor ciphertext with
  a counter?
