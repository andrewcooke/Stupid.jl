# Stupid

Analysis of the "stupid" cipher at http://news.quelsolaar.com/#comments101

## Introduction

**Motivation** - it seems that the only way to learn about ciphers is
to break them.  At the same time, the ciphers that I know are
ridiculously hard to break.  So breaking an "obviously bad" design
might be a good first step.

**Structure** - this page contains only a basic summary of the code
and results.  There are links to source files, which contain more
information in the comments.

**Language** - [Julia](http://julialang.org/) combines the speed of C
(or close) with the flexibility of Python and has ambitions to replace
statistical analysis packages like R.
